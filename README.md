# tennis

Simple Java Swing based tennis (ping-pong-style)

This is a simple demo with an optional RMI based gaming server.

Back in 2003 it started as a learning project under Java 5 with an Apache Ant `build.xml`.
Later I added an Apache Maven `pom.xml` and now it also supports a Gradle `build.gradle` build.
